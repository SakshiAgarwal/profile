In my senior year studying Electrical engineering, I created a model used for indexing keywords for Biomedical Articles as part of my undergraduate thesis in the Department of Computer Science at IIT Kharagpur. 

Under the guidance of [Professor Sudeshna Sarkar](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sudeshna/), I successfully completed the tagging of abstract biomedical articles. Capturing the semantics of the abstract was our major focus. You can refer to the [report](https://sakshiagarwal.github.io/BTPReport.pdf) for a detailed approach. This was the first time I worked with Biomedical texts and was surprised how well RNNs capture the semantic relations between Biomedical text!
