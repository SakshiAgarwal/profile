In my senior year studying Electrical engineering, I created a model used for indexing keywords for Biomedical Articles using their abstracts as part of my undergraduate thesis in the Department of Computer Science at IIT Kharagpur. Under the guidance of [Professor Sudeshna Sarkar](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sudeshna/), I successfully completed the tagging of abstract biomedical articles. Capturing the semantics of the abstract was our major focus. You can refer to the [report] (https://sakshiagarwal.github.io/BTPReport.pdf) for a detailed approach with an explained word2vec model for this model along with many examples of similarities between words learnt by the word2vec model. Further, simple classification task is modeled by RNNs (Keras implementation) and comparisons are shown between simple RNNs, LSTMs and GRUs.
