Odium Revelio! is one of the research threads I'm working on to detect subtle hate speech on online conversations or comments. Motivated by the recent spread of toxicity, hatred and abuse on social media, we aim to detect these comments and flag them.

1. 	Key feature engineering involves inclusion of previous comments, title references along with external information from wikipedia pages.
2. 	Scraping from fox-news articles to enrich our dataset to create a more balanced dataset to work on.
3. 	Using inter-attention and intra-attention models to achieve this problem.
