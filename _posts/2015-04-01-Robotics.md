During my B.Tech, I was involved in various campus activities - from participating in workshops in my 1st year to mentoring freshers and conducting robotics events in fests.The [team](https://robotix.in) collectively put up a tech fest, conduected tutorials for students in campus and inculcate research in students.

Starting from the workshops I co-mentored(reports can be found [here] and [here]
Kharagpur Quadrotor Group	         [Novâ€™2014 - Present]

Working on an autonomous quadrotor capable of participating in IARC Mission 7 (International Aerial Robotics Competition). The problem involves making an autonomous quadrotor that can track 10 ground robots, avoid obstacles and direct the ground robots towards a goal by descending on them.

Winter Workshops | IIT Kharagpur	          [Dec 2014]

Supervised the creation of an autonomous robot capable of following a 4*4 grid and detect obstacles using a sonar and a robot capable of following simple hand gestures using an accelerometer and direct signals accordingly to another robot using UART communication.

Successful mentorship of IEEE and Texas Instruments certified Winter Workshop 2014-15, at IIT Kharagpur
