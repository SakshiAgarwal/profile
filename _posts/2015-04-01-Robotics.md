During my B.Tech, I was involved in various robotics related campus activities - 

1. Participated in workshops in my first year 
2. Co-mentored two workshop for freshers in my second year of undergraduation - you could refer to the day-wise documentation of the students and what they learnt ([Phase 1](https://sakshiagarwal.github.io/phase-1.pdf) and [Phase 2](https://sakshiagarwal.github.io/phase-2.pdf)
3. Conducted robotics events in the year 2015 for our tech fest. Prototyped bots as stated by the event rules and created tutorial videos of the same for prospective participants.
4. Worked on an autonomous quadrotor in the research group [Aerial Robotics Kharagpur](http://www.aerialroboticskgp.org/) in my third year of under-graduation.
