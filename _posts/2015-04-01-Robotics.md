During my B.Tech, I was involved in various campus activities - from participating in workshops in my 1st year to mentoring freshers and conducting robotics events in fests.The [team](https://robotix.in) collectively put up a tech fest, conduected tutorials for students in campus and inculcate research in students.

As a part of the team, I co-mentored two workshops in my second year of undergraduation - you could refer to the day-wise documentation of the students and what they learnt ([Phase 1](https://sakshiagarwal.github.io/phase-1.pdf) and [Phase 2](https://sakshiagarwal.github.io/phase-2.pdf). Apart from this, I was working on an autonomous quadrotor in the research group [Aerial Robotics Kharagpur](http://www.aerialroboticskgp.org/) in my third year of under-graduation.
