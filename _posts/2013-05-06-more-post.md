Police Business Intelligence is a crime analytics platform, which is designed to adhere to the needs to optimize the police resource allocation at various cities. It tackles a lot of problems - giving a descriptive analysis to the police of the crime patterns of their agencies, along with forecasting of crimes in the near furture. As a researcher on this team, I help create solutions to such problems requiring analysis. Some of my responsibilities include : 

1. Forecasting crimes like murder, rape day-wsie using state-of-the-art solutions. Further, solving the problem of sparse crime data streams for some cities for accurate prediction. Refer to the paper here.
2. Building a platform supporting distributed analytics for improved real-time performance on the site.
3. Currently, Visulization of the crime hotspots on the map of Denver (our experimental city).
