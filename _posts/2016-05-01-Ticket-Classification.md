title: Ticket Classification

Paper accepted at AAAI Workshop Crowdsourcing, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Agents

Built a system, implementing a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) classifier, to be integrated with an existing online interaction system where customers entered their queries regarding hardware, software and e-mail related issues Overfitting in RNNs was addressed by implementing existing state-of-the-art methods and their comparisons made. Significance performance increase (12% relatively) was recorded by implementing a proposed method of de-correlating hidden unit representations. Extensive experimentation was conducted on multiple datasets.
