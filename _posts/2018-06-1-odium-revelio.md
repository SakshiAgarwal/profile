title: Odium Revelio!

Odium Revelio! is a model designed to detect hate speech for online conversations or comments. This model not only focuses on marking overt hate speech comments but also subtle ones. As for example :

Motivated by the recent spread of toxicity, hatred and abuse on social media, we are inspired to detect these hateful comments and flag them.

As a researcher on the text analytics team, I am exploring and implementing state-of-the-art models in the application of subtle hate speech detection. We solve this this problem by focusing majorly on feature engineering. Thus, aggregating the title, previous comments and external information for an improved classification of comments on an article or a social-media post seems like an obvious test case.

1. 	Key feature engineering involves inclusion of previous comments, title references along with external information from wikipedia pages.
2. 	Scraping from fox-news articles to enrich our dataset to create a more balanced dataset to work on.
3. 	Using inter-attention and intra-attention models to achieve this problem.
