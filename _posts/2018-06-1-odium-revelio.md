Odium Revelio! is a model designed to detect hate speech for online conversations or comments. This model not only focuses on marking overt hate speech comments but also subtle ones. As for example :

Motivated by the recent spread of toxicity, hatred and abuse on social media, we are inspired to detect these subtle or ambiguous hateful comments and flag them.

As a researcher on the text analytics team, I am exploring and implementing state-of-the-art models in the application of subtle hate speech detection. We solve this this problem by focusing majorly on feature engineering. Thus, aggregating the title, previous comments and external information for an improved classification of comments on an article or a social-media post seems like the most intuitive approach. You can read more about this [here] (https://sakshiagarwal.github.io/odium-revelio.pdf).

Some of the key features of this model include :

1. 	Feature engineering involving attention on previous comments, title references along with external information from wikipedia pages.
2. 	Scraping from fox-news articles to enrich our dataset to create a more balanced dataset to work on.
3. 	Using a variation of intra-attention - inter-attention on sentences and titles to achieve this problem.
