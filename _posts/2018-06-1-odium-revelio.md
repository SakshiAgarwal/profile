title: Odium Revelio!
---

Odium Revelio! is a model designed to detect hate speech for online conversations or comments on an article. This model not only focuses on marking overt hate speech comments but also subtle ones. As for example :

Motivated by the recent spread of toxicity, hatred and abuse on social media, we are inspired to detect these subtle or ambiguous hateful comments and flag them.

As a researcher on the text analytics team, I am exploring and implementing state-of-the-art models in the application of subtle hate speech detection. We solve this this problem by focusing majorly on feature engineering aggregating the title, previous comments and external information. You can read more about this [here](https://sakshiagarwal.github.io/odium-revelio.pdf).

My responsibilities include :

1. 	Feature engineering on previous comments, titles of the post along with external information from wikipedia pages.
2. 	Scraping from fox-news articles to enrich our dataset to create a more balanced dataset to work on.
3. 	Using a variation of intra-attention - inter-attention on sentences and titles to achieve this problem.
