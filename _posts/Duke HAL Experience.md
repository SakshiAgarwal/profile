Wildlife Conservation Project 								           [May’2015 - July’2015]

Guided by Prof. Mary Cummings, Associate Professor, Duke University

The project aims to integrate an existing commercial drone, an infrared camera, and a tablet controller which allows an operator with no piloting skills the ability to track wildlife preserves at night. The drone thermal camera was well integrated with the drone and the tower application during the summer with the camera feed successfully being displayed on the tower app.
