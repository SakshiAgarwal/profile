Police Business Intelligence is an operational crime analytics platform, aimed to help police make informed decisions. This platform is designed to identify key crime performance indicators and caters to the needs of optimizing police resources and allocation at various cities. You can have a quick overview of the project [here](http://indialabs.conduent.com/innovation-story-detail-page/Operational%20Analytics%20for%20Police%20Business%20Intelligence).

There are many aspects to this platform. While here, as a researcher my responsibilities include : 

1. Building models for forecasting crimes like murder, rape etc on a day basis using state-of-the-art deep neural network solutions. On a very specific note, we solved the problem of forecasting in sparse crime data streams (cities with low crime data available with time over the past 5 years). You could take a look at the detailed approach and experimentation in the paper [here](https://sakshiagarwal.github.io/forecasting-sparse-data.pdf).

2. Building a platform on the Azure Cloud supporting distributed operational analytics for a better user experience on the site.
