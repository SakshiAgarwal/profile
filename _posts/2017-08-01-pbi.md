Police Business Intelligence is an operational crime analytics platform, aimed to help police make informed decisions. This platform is designed to identify key crime performance indicators and caters to the needs of optimizing police resources and allocation at various cities. You can have a quick overview of the project [here](http://indialabs.conduent.com/innovation-areas/).

There are many aspects to this platform. While here, as a researcher my responsibilities include : 

1. Building models for forecasting crimes like murder, rape etc on a day basis using state-of-the-art deep neural network solutions. On a very specific note, we solve the problem of forecasting in cities with low crime data available with time. 

2. Building a platform on the Azure Cloud supporting distributed operational analytics for a better user experience.

3. Conceptualised a decision support framework for a big data analytics platform so as to make design choices automated for constumers.  For more information, please look at the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8495792) published at IEEE World Congress On Services.
