title: Ticket Classification
---

I helped in building a ticket classification module during my internship at Tata Consultancy Service (TCS) Innovation Labs, India. This module was to be used internally by the company to automate the process of assigning a particular ticket as a software, hardware or e-mail issue. This module was to be added to a pre-existing online interaction system.   

During the internship period, after achieving the baseline results, a commom problem of overfitting in deep learning models (RNNs in our case) was solved. Significant performance increase (12% relatively) was recorded by implementing a proposed method of de-correlating hidden unit representations.
